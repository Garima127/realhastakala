                            Hastakala is an platform for Nepali artists to show case their products. Now you can directly purchase Handicraft goods from manufacturers themselves from the comfort of your home.

                            We realized that unlike Nepalese & Tibetan culture our handicrafts across the world drew lot of attention and appreciation for their traditionalism, and aestheticism. However, there was a gap in the supply of the genuine, traditional Nepalese handicraft products in the market. We came up with the project Hastakala to provide the appreciators of Nepalese arts & craft a portal through which they could purchase ethnic Nepali handicraft products executed in traditional techniques, designs and colors. The idea was to make ethnic Nepalese Handicrafts accessible across the globe with a simple click on a mouse.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Nepal being land of diverse cultures, languages, ethnicities and religions it has an amazing variety of handicraft products. We have selected and placed our products carefully to give you a wide variety of Nepali Handicraft with excellent quality products at best competitive rates. Explore your fascinating handicrafts store with all kinds of Art and crafts from Nepal.
